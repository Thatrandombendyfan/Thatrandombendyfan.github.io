<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">Bendy, fueled by rage, ended up becoming more of a monster than he really was, becoming larger, sronger, and all out muscular. Beast Bendy is all black ink with a big mout revealing sharp, pointy teeth. Although his arms are abnormally huge, legs and feet are abnormally small, almost nonexistant.The shoulders ar stretched and have a dull point to them, whereas his elbows and spine have sharp looking points to them. On each of his giant hands, there are holes imatating the dots on cartoon Bendy.</p>

<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 30px">The Giant Hand</p>

<img src="Ch5/Giant.png" width="400">
<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">The Giant Hand is a big cartoon-like hand that pops out of the ink river. It's a big left hand with a white glove and a lot of blisters, and ink on it. All four fingers have ink on the tips too. People assume that it is Ink Bendy's hand but due to the blisters, and ink stains, it is most likely a single creation gone wrong. When the boat stops, the hand will pop up and try to attack. Their isn't much to know about this entity</p>

<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 30px">Sammy Lawrence (chapter 5)</p>
<img src="Ch5/sammy.jpg" width= "700">
<img src="Ch5/S.jpg" width= "900">
<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px"> Although you witness Sammy die in chapter 2, you'll meet Sammy Lawrence in chapter 5,  and he's more hostile than he was in chapter two. Unlike in chapter two, he starts chasing you and attempts to kill you. He says at one point, "You said I'd be free..." but it doesn't seem to be pointed at you. He even says, "He lied! He always lies!" By "he" Sammy is hinting the creator, Joey Drew for Joey is know to lie. </p>
