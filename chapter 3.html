<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">The enemy Stricker, was supposed to be another real-life creation by the one and only, Joey Drew. Stricker has a few thick strings, alike rope or shoelace sewn in his head. His mouth is sewn shut and his teeth are sewn on top of his head always chattering mimicing plastic tooth toys. His right eye has been replaced by a real human eye, while his left is a pie-cut eye like a cartoon. His ears have also been covered in boils. Striker has three arms and two legs. Two of his arms and both of his legs are cartoon-like, while his left arm has a machine that make him strike his punches better.</p>

<img src="ch3/Fisher.png" width= "500">
<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">Fisher's rounded body wears what looks like a black suit and a belt that is written in ink which says "LIAR". He also whears a pair ofwhite stained gloves and ink-soaked boots. Fisher is a recreation of Barley from the butcher gang. Instead of a neak, he has a fishing rod, and his head hangs on a string. At first contact with Henry, Fisher will slowly walk up to Henry and attack him with his weapon, the wrench, and then start swinging his head to attack. Like the two other butcher gang members, if Fisher is lured into Ink Bendy's inky ring, he will die instantly. </p>

<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 30px">Twisted Alice</p>

<img src="ch3/ArchAlice.png" width= "500">
<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">Although there is no set name, fans call her Twisted Alice, and theorist belive that she was once a former worker, Susie Campbell. Twisted Alice seems like a young woman, looks similar to Alice Angel, with sraight black inky hair, and black lips. Half her head seems to be melted off, and she has a halo sticking out os her head and has a dress with a style from the early 19's. She has black ink that looks similar to sleeve gloves. Unlike Alice Angle, she wears tights. She is a somewhat friendly and maniplulative. This is how she make Henry do her bidding. there is no way to know twisted Alice's name unless you get the book, "Bendy and the Ink Machine Employees Handbook" it will say her name at the very end.</p>

<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 30px">Projectionist</p>
<img src="ch3/P.png" width= "1500">
<img src="ch3/Projection.png" width="700">
<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px">The Projectionist, who may have once been Norman Polk, is a creature made of primarily ink, with a head of a projector. There is one film reel stuck in his left shoulder, and if you look behind him there is ink covered wires poking out below his head, and into his arms, legs, and back. He also has a speaker sticking out of his chest, with the way he looks, that may be where he makesw his screeches. He seems to have two human-like hands, and big cartoon boots. Norman Polk and Sammy Lawrence have been transformed by Joey Drew at what seems like the same, if not similar, time as it shows at the end of Dreams Come to Life. For some unknown reason, the Projectionist does not have a spot in the chapter you unlock after completing all five chapters.</p>
